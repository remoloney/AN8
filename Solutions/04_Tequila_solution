The question asked is What Tequila products are not selling or sold.

This brings us to the number 1 thing in Data Analytics which is identifiying the problem. 

Does the client want to know which ones are not selling well, whichs ones we carry but have not sold, 
Maybe they want to know which products vendors have but we do not sell. 
And indeed what they are looking for is which items the vendor offers or that we have in our product line but are not sold.

So #1 problem is not code but getting the question dialed in, that can be extremely hard to do with a client even if you have had an hour
long meeting or several meetings to gather requirements. Be prepared to guess come up with a great answer to the wrong question and start over. 

Having said that here is the code: remember what we truly want to see is products we have in our products table but we do not carry them in our stores. 


335 items were not sold
SELECT item_description 
FROM products a 
LEFT JOIN sales b 
ON a.item_no = b.item
WHERE a.category_name like '%TEQUILA%' 
AND  b.store IS null
